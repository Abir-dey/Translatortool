            The web3 gaming world has been a work in progress for a handful of
            years now. Studios in the space have found it difficult to gain Web
            2 gamers’ trust and get over the image issues resulting from the
            “play-to-earn” era, and traction has been slower than predicted. So,
            what will it take to spur more mainstream gamers to pick up and play
            web3 games?<br />
            Amid the ongoing crypto bear market, investors and startups alike
            are diving deeper into the emerging space to answer that very
            question (among others) as they look to web3 gaming to bring in the
            next wave of users to crypto and the wider web3 industry.<br />
            So to find out how the industry is thinking about the next phase of
            growth in web3 gaming, we spoke to eight people with strong track
            records in the industry about the future of the space, how they’re
            tackling challenges and more.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            For Ed Chang, head of gaming at Ava Labs, the web3 industry is still
            arguably young, but he’s hopeful that there’s space for web3
            elements to be complementary to the gaming experience and add value.
            “We believe that all games can leverage blockchain elements, whether
            it’s truly owning your items, earning rewards for playing, or
            building payment rails for microtransactions, creators and modders,”
            he said.<br />
            We’re widening our lens, looking for more founders and investors to
            participate in TechCrunch+ surveys, where we poll top professionals
            about challenges and opportunities in their industry.

            However, several of these people noted that web3 gaming still has
            some pretty difficult hurdles to overcome before it can go
            mainstream. “The biggest challenge is that we are still figuring out
            how to design web3 games and deciding as an industry if we would
            rather prioritize the “play” or the “earn” part,” Tiffany Dong,
            senior associate for gaming at Solana Foundation, said.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            The very obvious UX (user experience) problem with web3 is also
            something that’s being worked on. Robbie Ferguson, co-founder and
            president of Immutable, said, “Most web3 services expect the user to
            set up a new wallet and connect it with their platform. This already
            includes multiple steps of inconvenience that open up the door to
            catastrophic loss if not done correctly. Then there’s the fact that
            this process usually has to be done repeatedly for each service.”
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Still, the industry appears to be learning quickly. Dong pointed out
            a notable shift, where web3 game developers are focusing on building
            games that are engaging and fun for the community first, and
            complementing the experience with blockchain technology without
            using it to define it.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            As for the play-to-earn model, it appears to be on the way out.
            Carlos Roldan, CEO and founder of Elixir Games, noted that the term
            was “widely misused,” especially in the context of Ponzi and pyramid
            schemes that capitalized on the trend. “This misuse took advantage
            of the play-to-earn trend that was particularly hot during
            2021–2022. Post-trend, the term has become almost obsolete, and the
            industry is shifting toward more accurate descriptors like ‘play to
            own,’ ‘play and earn,’ or ‘win to earn,’ which better align with the
            true gaming experience. I’ll stick with ‘play to enjoy’ if I have a
            choice,” he said.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            How big is the web3 gaming market today? And what metric do you
            think works best to track growth?
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Web3 gaming is still in a nascent stage. The industry had an initial
            wave in 2021 with the play-to-earn model. That model,
            unsurprisingly, was not sustainable, but it did get game developers
            and investors excited about opportunities in web3 gaming. We are now
            in a quiet period, as many studios that formed and raised funding
            back then are building games. I expect the market to remain largely
            quiet until some of these second-wave web3 games start to launch
            next year. Metrics to track will be largely the same that any game
            tracks: installs, DAU, retention, LTV, etc. In addition to that,
            we’ll be tracking web3-specific KPIs such as wallet and marketplace
            metrics.
