            US finds no evidence Huawei can mass produce advanced phone chips

            The ability of Huawei — and China at large — to manufacture advanced
            chips amid U.S. sanctions has again come into question as
            conflicting claims arise. The U.S. finds no evidence that the
            Chinese smartphone and telecom giant Huawei can produce smartphones
            with advanced semiconductors at scale, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina
            Raimondo said on Tuesday. The claim came two months after tech
            research firms suggested Huawei was poised for a return to the 5G
            smartphone industry by the end of this year. The reports were soon
            reassured by Huawei’s launch of the Mate 60 Pro in late August.
            According to a device teardown by analysis TechInsights, the model
            is powered by a 7nm system-on-chip (SoC) designed by Huawei’s chip
            division HiSilicon and produced by China’s chipmaking giant SMIC.

            “Discovering a Kirin chip using SMIC’s 7nm (N+2) foundry process in
            the new Huawei Mate 60 Pro smartphone demonstrates the technical
            progress China’s semiconductor industry has been able to make
            without EUV lithography tools,” said Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of
            TechInsights, in the report. Nonetheless, Raimondo said during a
            U.S. House hearing that “we don’t have any evidence that they can
            manufacture seven-nanometer at scale.” In 2019, the U.S. government
            added Huawei to an entity list that barred it from accessing
            high-end chipmaking tools from the U.S., citing national security
            concerns. The sanctions have decimated the Chinese behemoth’s
            handset business, forcing it to diversify revenue streams into less
            familiar areas such as IoTs and automotive. The future of China’s
            advanced chipmaking industry was further shrouded in uncertainty
            after Oppo, another Chinese smartphone giant, disbanded its
            semiconductor unit as global smartphone shipments slowed down.
