            Google announced today that it is opening access to more
            contributors to participate in Road Mapper, a tool where you can add
            missing roads to Google Maps in areas of the world that need it
            most. The company also noted in today’s blog post that its
            contributors have mapped more than 1.5 million kilometers of roads,
            enabling more than 200 million people to navigate with Google Maps.
            The milestone is notable since Road Mapper only launched two years
            ago. Road Mapper is an invite-only platform where people participate
            in challenges, drawing roads located in areas with a large
            population, yet have a significant amount of road network missing
            from Google Maps. Users draw road geometry using satellite images.
            The drawings then go through a review process and, if accepted, will
            be live on Google Maps in a few days.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Those interested in joining Road Mapper can fill out Google’s online
            form. Plus, top contributors that have mapped the most roads can now
            refer up to five contributors via the Road Mapper Referral form. “A
            huge thank you to everyone who has been a part of Road Mapper for a
            while,” Google wrote. “Their contributions have made a real
            difference in people’s lives worldwide.”
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Road Mapper works similarly to OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is
            considered one of the largest crowd-sourced mapping projects with
            over 10 million contributors. However, OSM is open source and
            accessible by anyone. In related news, a group called the Overture
            Maps Foundation recently released its first open map dataset,
            allowing third-party developers to easily build mapping or
            navigation products and compete with tech giants Google and Apple.
            The group was formed by Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and mapping company
            TomTom.
