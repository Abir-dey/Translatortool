            Somani’s Offline secures $2M to build community for top Indian
            startup founders

            Utsav Somani, who helped AngelList launch in India and oversaw its
            local operations for five years, is gearing up to find more ways to
            help founders. On Wednesday, the entrepreneur said he had raised $2
            million for his new venture, called Offline, that will aim to bring
            the top Indian startup founders together and form a community so
            that they can upskill and discuss the problems challenging their
            growth. Paid communities have been ubiquitous for large business
            owners, and multi-geography organizations such as Young Presidents’
            Organization (YPO) and Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) have existed
            in India for traditional businesses for some time. These platforms
            provide networking opportunities for entrepreneurs to connect with
            peers who share similar interests and goals. However, startup
            founders in India haven’t necessarily had a similar community to
            turn to until now.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Somani said in an interview that he identified that there was a need
            for a specialized networking platform while working with over 150
            startups as an investor. In July, he left his top role at AngelList
            India and subsequently founded Offline. “Over the last seven to
            eight years, the Indian ecosystem has taken a huge, huge jump into
            this stratosphere,” he said. “We’ve attracted so much capital, but
            are we becoming better founders ourselves . . . everybody started
            talking about personal therapy, but is there a way for us to think
            about professional therapy?” Offline operates as an exclusive, paid
            community where members are required to pay an annual fee of about
            $6,000 (500,000 Indian rupees) and a one-time fee of $600. To even
            apply, founders must have either raised $5 million, or generated $5
            million in revenue, or achieved a $10 million exit in the past.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Yet, fulfilling these prerequisites doesn’t guarantee a seat at the
            table. Candidates undergo a rigorous interview by the Offline team
            and the final selections are then presented to a Membership Advisory
            Committee. This strict screening process is aimed at maintaining a
            community comprising only the crème de la crème of startup founders.
            “We are not looking to scale up to 1,000 members in a year,” Somani
            said. “What we’re looking for is a couple hundred members in the
            first couple of years.” Upon successful membership, individuals are
            grouped into “pods” with six to eight peers. They gain the privilege
            to participate in meticulously curated monthly meetings dubbed
            “off-the-record.” During these sessions, a skilled executive coach
            provides insights and solutions on diverse issues. Each meeting is
            guided by a playbook, which draws inspiration from the methodologies
            of Georgia Dienst from the Mochary Method.

            Members can attend unique social events and connect instantly for
            advice. They can also network with peers from different chapters
            online or at annual retreats. Every Offline member must sign a
            strict privacy agreement, ensuring confidentiality during
            interactions. With an aim to include only the top 10% of India’s
            tech founders, the platform mandates a minimum 80% attendance rate.
            VC funds like Peak XV Partners (previously Sequoia Capital India &
            SEA) host events to aid startup founders in skill enhancement and
            networking with seasoned founders. However, these events tend to be
            aimed at their own portfolio startups. “We are not judging you based
            on who you raise capital from and what investor you have on your cap
            table . . . we are a very neutral platform,” said Somani. A number
            of executives and founders, including those with Groww, Razorpay,
            Polygon, CoinDCX, UltraHuman, Park+, M2P, Fashinza, Xiaomi have
            backed Offline in its maiden funding. Better Capital, DeVC, Huddle,
            and Riverwalk Ventures also invested. Somani said some of Offline’s
            investors may become early customers and help promote the platform
            in their own networks.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            While Offline is a unique move for Indian startup founders, the U.S.
            already has some of its competitors, including Hampton by Sam Parr
            and women executives-centric Chief, which is valued at over $1
            billion. “It’s a very large business if you get a focused community
            in a world where there’s too much noise,” Somani said. He noted that
            while India is the first and foremost market for Offline, it has
            Singapore and Dubai on its cards. The application window for
            Offline’s membership will open starting today.
