            Google-backed audio content platform Kuku FM has raised $25 million
            in a new funding round as it looks to make deeper inroads with its
            audiobook offerings in the South Asian market. Indian billionaire
            and technologist Nandan Nilekani’s Fundamentum Partnership led the
            Series C funding in Kuku FM, with International Finance Corporation,
            part of the World Bank. Temasek-backed Vertex Ventures also
            participated in the new financing round, said the five-year-old
            startup that counts 3one4 Capital and Krafton also among its
            backers.

            <p class="details">
            Kuku FM, which has raised over $60 million to date, operates an
            eponymous audio platform that offers over 150,000 hours of content
            in genres including personal finance, romance, religion and
            self-help. The content, available in six Indian languages and
            English, is pertinent to the local context and has helped Kuku FM
            make deeper inroads with consumers in smaller Indian cities, towns
            and villages. The startup neither displays ads nor provides
            complimentary content, only permitting users to sample parts of
            episodes within a series. Instead it charges 99 Indian rupees
            (equivalent to $1.2) for a monthly subscription and 999 Indian
            rupees for an annual one, granting users unlimited access to its
            content.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                        Lal Chand Bisu, co-founder and chief executive of Kuku FM, told
            TechCrunch in an interview that the startup has more than doubled
            its revenue in the last year and it’s currently on track to generate
            $15 million revenue annually. It’s aiming to become profitable by
            the end of next year, he said. Consumption of audio content is
            increasingly rising in popularity in India, thanks to the widespread
            availability of affordable smartphones and internet access. As vast
            numbers of Indians join the online community, there’s a growing
            demand for content that resonates with their preferences and is
            available in their desired language. Amazon is also amplifying its
            footprint with Audible in India, partnering with local production
            entities to enrich the platform’s offerings. Kuku FM has captured a
            wider market share due to its unlimited consumption model, rather
            than charging consumers for each piece of content. Bisu said the
            platform collaborates with more than 30,000 professional content
            creators who provide their titles to the platform. To ensure
            quality, the startup employs a rigorous vetting process.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
            “Kuku FM has created a niche category which caters to the unique and
            rapidly evolving demands of the new digital natives of India,” said
            Prateek Jain, a principal at Fundamentum Partnership, in a
            statement. “Moreover, Bisu and team have demonstrated a great
            understanding in terms of creating a business model with strong
            focus on unit economics and robust fundamentals.” Kuku FM plans to
            use the new funding to expand its catalog, with a particular
            emphasis on broadening its educational content offerings, said Bisu.
