            WhatsApp is introducing Flows for a richer in-app shopping
            experience

            WhatsApp is bolstering its shopping experience for both merchants
            and users through a new feature called Flows, which will let users
            complete tasks such as picking a seat on a flight or booking an
            appointment without leaving the app. Merchants will have building
            blocks ranging from a text box to a calendar and a seat picker to
            build these experiences. WhatsApp said these tools will be available
            to businesses in the coming months. A support page for Flows
            indicates use cases like booking appointments, product
            customization, logging into their accounts, filling out forms, and
            signing up for events. The company said it has been testing flows
            with businesses such as Brazilian bank Banco Pan, retailer MagaLu,
            Lenovo, Indian travel service redBus, India-based bank SBI, and
            car-reselling platform Spinny.

            “Shopping and e-commerce is one of the biggest verticals we want to
            focus on. The goal is to enable business messaging in a way that
            businesses and people can do a lot more right in the chat thread. We
            are trying to build rich experiences within the chat, and that’s
            where Flows comes in,” Nikila Srinivasan, VP of business messaging
            at Meta, told TechCrunch. Srinivasan added that while Flows might be
            used by e-commerce businesses at the moment, WhatsApp wants to build
            rich experiences for other types of businesses as well. Meta is not
            charging merchants for Flows separately. The company told TechCrunch
            that conversations with Flows will fit in under the current payment
            model. WhatsApp currently charges businesses for conversations
            (interactions in a 24-hour window), which are categorized by
            marketing, utility, authentication, and service. So, for instance, a
            request by the customer to book an appointment is likely to fall
            under the utility category.

            The company is also introducing new payment partners for the
            checkout experience for customers in India — where WhatsApp has more
            than 500 million users. Last year, WhatsApp partnered with Reliance
            Jio for an end-to-end shopping experience, but customers could only
            pay through the UPI-based — Unified Payment Interface network —
            WhatsApp Pay without leaving the app. Now it has teamed up with
            payment gateway providers Razorpay and PayU so users can pay through
            other UPI apps, and credit, and debit cards.
          </p>
          <p class="details">
            Earlier this year, WhatsApp introduced users to merchant payment in
            Brazil and Singapore. WhatsApp business revenue depends on merchants
            having more conversations and completing transactions. With Flows
            and extended payment support in India, the company likely wants to
            encourage end-to-end shopping experiences in order to increase
            frequent business transactions.
            <br />
            Earlier this year, WhatsApp said that its Business app had crossed
            200 million monthly active users. The company said today that it has
            also started testing the personalized messages feature for
            merchants, which was announced in June. The feature lets businesses
            send custom messages such as discounts or offers to select
            customers.
